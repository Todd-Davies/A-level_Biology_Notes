\section*{What is Photosynthesis?}
\thispagestyle{empty}
Photosynthesis is a metabolic reaction that takes place in plants and in some microorganims. The formulea for photosynthesis is:
\[
	6CO_2 + 6H_2O + energy \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2
\]
The goal of photosynthesis is to use light energy (usually from the Sun) to turn carbon dioxide and water into sugars that the organism can use to respire. It is a reduction reaction since carbon dioxide and water are both reduced.

\section*{ATP as an energy store}
Organisms use a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to store small amounts of energy in usable, portable and accessible amounts.
