\section*{What is recombinant DNA tecnhology?}
\thispagestyle{empty}
Recombinant DNA is the general name for taking a piece of one DNA, and combining
it with another strand of DNA. This new strand of DNA (now called rDNA) can be introduced into a cell to alter the cell's genotype.

\subsection*{Sample use cases of rDNA technology}
\subsubsection*{Insulin synthesis}
Insulin can be made by E.coli. Scientists isolated the gene for insulin
production and inserted it into a plasmid normally present in an E.coli
bacterium. The plasmid was then taken up by the E.coli cell. This meant that the bacterium now started to secrete human insulin, which could be harvested. The bacteria is then cultured in large fermenters that allow scientists to extract
large quantities of human insulin.

\subsubsection*{AAT synthesis}
AAT (alpha 1 antitrypsin protein) is a protein produced by humans that helps
protect body tissue from the harmful effects of other proteins. Some people have
a genetic defect that means that not enough AAT is produced, which leads to emphysema due to enzymes destroying alveoli walls and reducing their elastcity. Scientists added DNA that produces AAT to the embryo of a female sheep, which
they then cloned many times. The protein is then extracted from the milk of
these transformed sheep to use as a treatment for AAT deficiency induced
emphysema. {\it N.b. this won't treat smoking induced emphysema since the same disease is brought about via a different cause.}

\subsubsection*{Cystic fibrosis treatment}
Cystic fibrosis is caused by a mutation in the human CTFR gene. The CTFR gene
codes for a protein that transports chloride across epithelial cell membranes.
When the CTFR gene is mutated, the tertiary structure of the CTFR protein
changes, so no chloride ions can be actively transported out of epithelial
cells. If chloride ions {\it were} transported (like they are in normal cells),
then the water potential of the lumen would decrease so that water would pass
out of the cell by osmosis. In people with cystic fibrosis this doesn't happen
since the CTFR protein doesn't work and the fluid in the lumen becomes very
viscous. 

It is possible to extract healthy CTFR genes from 'normal' people, but in order
to treat a patient with cystic fibrosis, these genes must be inserted into each
of the billions of cells that have CTFR proteins in the patients body. It is
possible to do that in a number of ways:

	Wrap healthy CTFR genes in lipids that are absorbed into the patient's
	cells through the cell wall. & Most genes that are absorbed aren't expressed
	by the cell, so few cells are made to function properly.\\ \midrule
	Insert healthy CTFR genes into harmless viruses that then infect the
	patient's epithelial cells and release their payload of CTFR gene into the
	cell. & The viruses released don't harm the cell or replicate (in theory,
	though there have been cases in trials where the viruses did act as
	pathogens), but there is only a slim chance that the deposited genes will
	get into the nucleus and start being used to create proteins.\\ \midrule

\subsection*{Gene therapy for SCID}
SCID (Severe Combined ImmunoDeficiency disease) is a rare inherited condition 
that renders the immune system of children useless, which means that they are susceptible to infections that while normally trivial for healthy children, can develop into life threatening ilnesses.

Currently, the only technique used to combat SCID is to have the child wear an
'isolation bubble', to prevent exposure to pathogens.

The disease is brought about by the child having inherited a set of faulty
alleles, meaning that the enzyme {\it adenosine deaminase (ADA)} isn't produced.
In the absence of this enzyme, T lympocytes (which normally detect pathogens
that have entered the body) cannot function and are destroyed.

\subsubsection*{Gene therapy}

Gene therapy is being used to treat SCID. The aim of the treatment is to replace
the T lymphocytes in the child's body with ones that have the normal ADA gene.
This is acheived using the following method:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item A restriction endonuclease is used to isolate the normal ADA gene from
	the DNA of a healthy cell (by cutting the DNA when it meets a specific
	sequence of bases).

	\item The normal ADA gene is inserted into a virus, which is then allowed to
	replicate in a cell culture to produce large numbers of the virus.

	\item T lymphocytes are extracted from the patient's bone marrow and are
	cloned to increase their number.

	\item The viruses with the ADA gene are mixed with the (cloned) T
	lymphocytes of the patient. The viruses inject their payload of DNA into
	the nuclei of the T lymphocytes.

	\item The white blood cells with the 'normal' ADA gene are transfused back
	into the patient where they will undergo mitosis and provide a supply of
	white blood cells {\it with} the healthy ADA gene.

\end{enumerate}
