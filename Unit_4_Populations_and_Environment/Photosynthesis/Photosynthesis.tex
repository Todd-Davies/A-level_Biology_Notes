\section*{What is Photosynthesis?}
\thispagestyle{empty}
Photosynthesis is a metabolic reaction that takes place in plants and in some microorganims. The formulea for photosynthesis is:
\[
	6CO_2 + 6H_2O + energy \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2
\]
The goal of photosynthesis is to use light energy (usually from the Sun) to turn carbon dioxide and water into sugars that the organism can use to respire. It is a reduction reaction since carbon dioxide and water are both reduced.

Photosynthesis takes place in the \textit{chloroplasts}.
\section*{ATP as an energy store}
Organisms use a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to store small amounts of energy in usable, portable and accessible amounts. ATP is often refered to as the energy currency of cells. 

As the name suggests, an ATP molecule has three phosphate groups. A phosphate (pi) molecule is added to ADP to make ATP:
\[
	ADP + pi + energy \rightarrow ATP
\]

Reasons that the body uses ATP as it's energy currency include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Each ATP molecule contains a useful amount of energy. As a comparison, one glucose molecule would probably contain too much energy for cell reactions and so energy would be wasted as heat.
	\item ATP can be broken down to ADP very quickly and so energy can be released for use immediately.
\end{itemize}

\section*{How does photosynthesis work?}
There are two stages in phtosynthesis, the \textbf{light dependent reaction} and the \textbf{light independent reaction}. They happen simultaniously and don't directly require each other in order to work.

However, the light independent reaction does need products from the light dependent reaction in order to have the energy it needs to work.

Here is a diagram of the interconnection between the reactions:

\subsection*{The light dependent reaction}
In this reaction, energy is captured from light by pigments such as chlorophyll and used to split water and create both ATP and NADP.

The light dependent reaction takes place in the \textbf{thylakoids}. The thylakoids contain pigments such as chlorophyll and other carotenoids. These molecules are able to absorb light and use it to boost an electron to higher energy levels. The energy from this electron is then used to power three different reactions:
\begin {itemize}
 \item Photolysis
 \item Photophosphorylation
 \item Production of reduced NADP
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsubsection*{Photolysis}
Here, the excited electrons from the chlorophyll are used to split water into three different parts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Protons ($H^{+}$)
	\item Electrons ($e^{-}$)
	\item Oxygen
\end{itemize}
This is the reaction that produces the oxygen that is released into the environment. The equation for the reaction is as follows:
\[
	2H_2O \rightarrow 4H^+ + 4e^- + O_2
\]

\subsubsection*{Photophosphorylation}
The excited electrons are also used to produce ATP. The reaction is as follows:
\[
	ADP + Pi + \textrm{\textit{energy from excited electrons}} \rightarrow ATP
\]
This process is facilitated by many different electron carriers in the \textbf{electron transport chain}. The electron transport chain pumps hydrogen ions against their concentration gradient into spaces in the thylakoid membranes. The membrane is not permeable to hydrogen ions and so in order to flow back to the other side they must pass through ATPases which add a phosphate group to ADP molecules to create ATP.

\subsubsection*{Production of reduced NADP}
Since electrons can't react with most molecules on their own, they require an electron carrier such as NADP to facilitate transport and reactions. In order to retain it's neutral charge, NADP molecules accept both a proton and an electron when they are reduced.
\[
	NADP + H^+ + e^- +\textrm{\textit{energy from excited electrons}}\rightarrow \textrm{\textit{reduced NADP}}
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item Takes place in thylakoids
    \item Electrons in chlorophyll excited
    \item Electrons in photolysis of water
    \item NADP is then reduced
    \item ATP generated from photophosphorylation
		\item ATPase acts as $H^+$ carrier
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection*{The light independent reaction}
The light dependent reaction takes place in the \textbf{stroma}. As the name suggests, this reaction doesn't need light to take place, however in practice this reaction does stop after dark since it requires resources from the light dependent reaction to function. In this stage of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide is taken from the atmosphere and turned into carbohydrates.

The Calvin cycle describes what happens during the light independent reaction:
